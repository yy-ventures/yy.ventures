    <h1>Meet the top innovators at WASH Innovation Challenge</h1>
    <div class="post-paragraphs">
      <p>
        Bangladesh has made considerable progress towards providing access to
        improved water sources, yet, in almost two out of five households,
        microbial quality of the drinking water worsened has from source to
        household, and other challenges to ensure quality drinking water
        nationwide has also increased. Each year about 45,000 children under 5
        years old die from diarrhea, caused by dirty water and poor toilet
        facilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Innovation is essential to bring about better solutions, which can serve
        the people of bottom of the pyramid with improved access to water,
        sanitation, and hygiene. This will lead to a significantly better
        quality of life for everyone, especially the future generations.
      </p>
      <p>
        YY Ventures had partnered with Aqua for All, Bopinc, and GSMA for the
        first time to launch the WASH Innovation Challenge in Bangladesh. This
        program was launched with a collective mission to achieve Sustainable
        Development Goal 6- clean water and sanitation for all, by empowering
        the most promising WASH entrepreneurs and innovators in Bangladesh who
        are focused on improving access to clean water, hygiene, and sanitation
        for all.
      </p>
      <p>
        After an intensive selection process, 12 organizations had been selected
        to take on the WASH Innovation Challenge. The participating teams had
        the opportunity of attending a 3-day long boot camp and received
        tailored mentoring from seasoned WASH business experts. One winning team
        will get a cash prize at the end of the program, and top participants
        will gain the opportunity to apply for further funding.

            From YY Ventures, we are super excited to be supporting these teams who are working very hard to provide clean and safe drinking water, sanitation & hygiene to hard-to-reach areas especially as these are basic human rights. Without safe drinking water, reduction of morbidity and mortality in mothers, newborn babies and children, improved nutrition, school attendance and time savings for productive activities cannot be achieved. 
        </p>
        <p>
            More collaborators are needed in the WASH sector of to engage in more innovative activities to accelerate access to sustainable WASH services in all critical spaces and communities without a voice.
        </p>
        <p>
            Due to COVID-19, the WASH sector is more vulnerable than ever and needs our urgent commitment. We must collaborate, boost our aspirations, and prioritize marginalized individuals in our collaborative efforts. Only then we will be able to contribute more significantly to national and global pledges to achieve universal access to WASH through such partnerships.
